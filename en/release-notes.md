#### Feature Updates

##### VPC

* Released Public API v2, which is compatible with Openstack API.  

##### Load Balancer

- The instance of a different subnet that belongs to the same VPC as Load Balancer can be registered as a member of Load Balancer. The subnet to which Load Balancer belongs and the subnet of the instance need to be connected to the routing table.
- The instance that belongs to a peer VPC can be registered as a member of Load Balancer if the VPC to which Load Balancer belongs has a peering connection. Only the instances of the subnet connected to the default routing table of the peer VPC can be connected.
- Now, the member instance of each listener can be configured differently. Previously, all the listeners needed to have the same member instance when running multiple listeners in Load Balancer.
